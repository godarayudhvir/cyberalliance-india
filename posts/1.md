At Cyber Alliance, we prioritize stability. This guide covers the bare-metal or VPS deployment of Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat), focusing on disk LVM configuration and remote access standards.

## Prerequisites
* An x86_64 or ARM64 system with minimum 2GB RAM.
* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Live Server ISO.
* A client machine with an SSH key pair generated.

## Step 1 — System Boot and Localization
After booting from the installation media, the installer will initialize. 
1. Select your **Language** and **Keyboard Layout**.
2. Choose **Ubuntu Server** (do not select the minimized version if you require standard drivers and tools out of the box).

## Step 2 — Networking Configuration
The installer uses `subiquity`. It is standard practice to configure a static IPv4 address for server infrastructure:
* **Method:** Manual
* **Subnet:** `192.168.1.0/24` (Example)
* **Address:** `192.168.1.50`
* **Gateway/DNS:** Point to your local gateway or upstream providers like `1.1.1.1`.

## Step 3 — Guided Storage Layout
To adhere to our **Scale** pillar, we utilize the Logical Volume Manager (LVM):
1. Select **Use an entire disk**.
2. Ensure **Set up this disk as an LVM group** is checked.
3. **Optional:** Select "Encrypt the LVM group with LUKS" if physical security of the hardware is a concern.
4. Confirm the destructive action to write changes to the disk.

## Step 4 — Profile Setup and SSH Injection
DigitalOcean standards emphasize key-based authentication over passwords:
1. Enter your **Hostname** and **Username**.
2. Select **Install OpenSSH Server**.
3. **Import SSH Keys:** Choose "Import from GitHub" or "Import from Launchpad" to automatically pull your authorized public keys into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

## Step 5 — Finishing the Installation
Once the "Install Complete" message appears, select **Reboot Now**. Ensure you remove the installation media to prevent a boot loop.

### Post-Install Verification
Once rebooted, verify your OS version and kernel:
```bash
lsb_release -a
uname -r
